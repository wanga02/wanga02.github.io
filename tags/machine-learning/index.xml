      <description>Ariana Grande is one of the most recognisable faces of pop right now, with an equally recognisable voice and musical style. She&amp;rsquo;s known for making pop-R&amp;amp;B hits, with more recent albums particularly influenced by hip hop, trap and electronic music/EDM.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of AG lately, who I find easy to binge because of the consistency in sound across her albums. But it&amp;rsquo;s also made me notice how different some of the songs are, like the light is coming from Sweetener (2018) which is so repetitive that I can&amp;rsquo;t actually listen to it, trap-pop banger 7 rings (thank u, next - 2019), or her trend of acapella/classical album openers like Intro (My Everything - 2014), raindrops (an angel cried) (Sweetener - 2018), and shut up (Positions - 2021).</description>

      <description>Three lockdowns and a year of quarantine later, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself with a few more hobbies and interests. Not quite a daily Yoga with Adriene habit (though I did manage about half a month before falling off that wagon) - but I have been playing a lot of Magic: The Gathering with friends.
To those unacquainted, MTG was released in 1993 and is the world&amp;rsquo;s first trading card game - these days it also exists as an impressive and pandemic-friendly online interface.</description>
